Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive, detailed roadmap for building your Smart CRM SaaS, from Free MVP → Paid features → full SaaS deployment, including frontend, backend, AI modules, multi-tenant design, roles, subscriptions, and deployment. I’ve structured it phase by phase with clear tasks:

Smart CRM Roadmap – Free → Paid SaaS
Phase 0 – Planning & Architecture

Tasks:

Decide tech stack:

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
